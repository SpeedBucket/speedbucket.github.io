	<p class="lead">John Carvey is the creator and manufacturer of this Speed Bucket paint tray. In 2002 the older versions of this paint tray for the 18 inch roller became hard to find in the Denver area. The painting supplies stores were having trouble getting this style of paint tray from the manufacturer. John took it upon himself to revise and improve the design, build a new mold and to produce his own line of trays. Throughout the years, this paint tray has saved him countless hours of time and money.</p>
	<p>The Speed Bucket is a product of Integrity Painting Service Inc. We contribute 10% or more of all profits to non-profit groups.</p>
