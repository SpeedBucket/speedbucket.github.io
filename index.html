		<h2>Quality Counts</h2>
		<p>Other paint trays are hard to clean and do not hold very much paint. The Speed bucket holds 5 gallons in the horizontal position and 3 gallons in the vertical carrying position. The product is made from a practically indestructible material called polyethylene. We take pride in the creation and finished product of each Speed Bucket.</p>

		<h2>Time Is Money</h2>
		<p>A Large paint roller will speed up your rolling time and as a result get you through the job faster. The Speed Bucket is efficient for a 9 inch paint roller all the way up to the an 18 inch paint roller. The 14 inch paint roller allows me to apply 50% more paint to the wall with the same number of roller strokes. The 18 inch roller applies 100% more paint than the 9 inch paint roller.</p>

		<h2>200 Pound Test</h2>
		<p>Our production of the Speed Bucket is unique in that each paint tray takes over an hour at the factory to mold. By forming each paint tray slowly and with gradual heat, the product is far more durable than any other plastic or tin tray on the market.</p>
