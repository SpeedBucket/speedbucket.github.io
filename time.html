			<p class="lead">A Large paint roller will speed up your rolling time and as a result get you through the job faster.</p>
			<p>The Speed Bucket is efficient for a 9 inch paint roller all the way up to the an 18 inch paint roller. I prefer to use the 14 inch roller set up when I have more than a gallon or two to paint.</p>
			<p class="lead">The 14 inch paint roller allows me to apply 50% more paint to the wall with the same number of roller strokes.</p>
			<p>The 18 inch roller applies 100% more paint than the 9 inch paint roller. The weight of a large paint roller is not a factor because most of the time a paint roller is used it is on the wall surface and the wall supports the weight.</p>
			<p class="lead">The Speed Bucket is perfect for touch up painting.</p>
			<p>This paint tray carries like a suitcase as you walk to the areas you need to touch up. Because it is 24 inches wide and 14 inches deep I often paint small areas without a drop cloth. The Speed bucket catches the splatter from the paint roller.</p>
			<p class="lead">The large pour spout on this paint tray allows you to clean up fast and easily.</p>
			<p>The Speed Bucket is made out of Polyethylene so the dry paint peals out easy.</p>
