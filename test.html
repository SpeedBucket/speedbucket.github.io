			<p>Our production of the Speed Bucket is unique in that each paint tray takes over an hour at the factory to mold. By forming each paint tray slowly and with gradual heat, the product is far more durable than any other plastic or tin tray on the market. The product is made from a practically indestructible material called polyethylene. We take pride in the creation and finished product of each Speed Bucket.</p>
			<p>Forming the tray slowly, and using gradual heat with the polyethylene material makes the tray practically indestructible.</p>
